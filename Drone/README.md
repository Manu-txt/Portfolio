I always wanted to fly a drone but they tend to be a little too expensive. So here I will be creating my own drone from scracth. A lot of the things I will try to implement myself such as, PCD design, CAD designs, software, and etc. 

#Design Plan
I plan for this to be a relatively small and compant drone using 4 motors making it a Quadcopter. I must decided between 2 different designs, X or H frame. 

#Components
- Brushless motor x4
- Flight controller
- Bluetooth Module (HC-05) / or through WiFi
- Reciever
